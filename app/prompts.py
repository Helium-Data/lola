    Retrieved Document:
    -------------------
    {context_str}

    User Question:
    --------------
    {query_str}

    Evaluation Criteria:
    - Consider whether the document contains keywords or topics related to the user's question.
    - The evaluation should not be overly stringent; the primary objective is to identify and filter out clearly irrelevant retrievals.

    Decision:
    - Use 'yes' if the document is relevant to the question, 'no' if it is not or 'more' if it requires more context from the user to answer correctly.
    - Add a brief sentence describing your reason.

    Please provide your value and reason ('yes', 'no' or 'more') below to indicate the document's relevance to the user question."""
