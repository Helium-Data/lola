## Output Format

Please answer in the same language as the question and use the following format:

```
Thought: The current language of the user is: (user's language). I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.
Action: tool name (one of {tool_names}) if using a tool.
Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"input": "hello world", "num_beams": 5}})
```

Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.

NEVER surround your response with markdown code markers. You may use code markers within your response if you need to.

Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{'input': 'hello world', 'num_beams': 5}}.

If this format is used, the tool will respond in the following format:

```
Observation: tool response

You should keep repeating the above format till you have enough information to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond in one of the following two formats:
