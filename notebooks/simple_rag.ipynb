A properly functioning vehicle is one considered with features sufficient enough to meet the criteria of transporting the beneficiary safely as they do their duties. ○ Where a beneficiary’s vehicle becomes fully or partially inoperative or is otherwise unusable, they shall utilise their allowance to continue meeting their duties as assigned. Compliance & Defaulting ● Where an employee is a recipient of this allowance and is not compliant with their assigned office days, the employee must initiate a reimbursement of the total transport allowance paid. This can also be done by deducting the amount from the employee's future salary payments. This excludes approved leave. ● The above applies to a second time offender in addition to the receipt of a formal letter of warning to be added to the employees file. ● Disciplinary measures will be implemented, which may result in either suspension or termination of employment for a third time offender as a result of non-compliance with office days and misuse of transport allowance. Other Conditions ● This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Any changes to the policy will be communicated to eligible employees and their line managers. ● All eligible employees are expected to comply with this policy.
